# CCChecker.io

Welcome to the open-source project for [CCChecker.io](https://ccchecker.io), a website dedicated to credit card number validation and information.

## About CCChecker.io

CCChecker.io is a free online tool that allows users to validate credit card numbers.

## Core Technology

At the heart of CCChecker.io is the Luhn algorithm, a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, including credit card numbers. The implementation of this algorithm can be found in the `luhn-validator.ts` file in this repository.

## Features

- Credit card number validation
- Card type identification
- Issuing network detection
- Country of origin information
- Fast and reliable results

## Source Code

The main implementation of our credit card checking logic, including the Luhn validator, can be found in this repository. The core functionality is written in TypeScript for robust type checking and improved maintainability.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve CCChecker.io! Whether it's enhancing the algorithm, adding new features, or improving the user interface, your input is valuable. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
